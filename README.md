# Predictive Analytics by TensorFlow and Data Visualization for Euro Cup 2024
## Description:
This project aims to show advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict outcomes for the Euro Cup 2024. By utilizing player statistics, team performance metrics, and TensorFlow's deep learning capabilities, we aim to provide insightful predictions and visualizations that enhance the understanding and enjoyment of the tournament.

## Source and Preparation of the Data:
Data are collected from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/damirdizdarevic/uefa-euro-2024-players.

Handle missing values (if any).

One-hot encode categorical variables (e.g., position).

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Build and Train the Model:
We use TensorFlow/Keras to create and train a neural network model and evaluate it by MSE.
